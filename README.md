# toylang

Toylang is a toy-level scripting language. It's not very powerful, not very functional, even full of bugs. Frankly, it's not a really practical programming language.

Toylang was designed mainly for entertainment, but also could be used in embedded programs as a more powerful CLI module, so that the test commands can be more complex.
